I was unable to get conda and the environment.yml file to work on my system because
the kernel kept on dying, however, I have included the environment.yml if you would
like to try running it. However, using a Python venv with pip worked perfectly. Here are 
the steps you can use to run the notebook.

1. Create and activate your virtual environment (different on Windows and Mac/Linux).
Make sure you have navigated to the folder containing the environment folder once you have
created the virtual environment.

Windows commands:
python -m venv HW1_ENV
HW1_ENV\Scripts\Activate

Mac/Linux commands:
python -m venv HW1_ENV
source HW1_ENV/bin/Activate

2. Navigate to HW submission folder (HW1_Submission) and install packages with command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook HW1_Code.ipynb with your desired IDE and run all the cells in the
notebook. If you with to use jupyter lab in your browser, make sure to run these commands, 
then it will open and you can run all the cells. Make sure to select the virtual environment 
as your kernel (top right corner) once you are in the Jupyter Lab environment.

python -m ipykernel install --user --name=HW1_ENV
jupyter lab
